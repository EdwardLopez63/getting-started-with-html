<p><h2><u> Thinking Like A Programmer</u></h2></p>

<h4><u>Steps</u></h4>
  <p><b>1.Procedural Thinking</b></p>
  <p>It involves taking a problem and breaking it down into steps. Making an organized list will help.</p>
<p><b>2. Abstract Thinking</b></p>
  <p>Finding connection in stuff that you might not understand at first. I believe just by looking at the html tags, I was able to make connections I didn't fully understand.
<p><b>3. Systematic Debugging</b></p>
  <p>Ability to find the problems and figure out the possible causes of the problem. Kind of like when a new computer hardware configuration doesn't work. (Example: Messed up RAM in my computer)

<p><b>4. Technological Empathy</b></p>
  <p>Trying to understand how the computer sees things. Italics and boldness isn't just there automatically. HTML is key.

<p><b>5. Systems Thinkings</b></p> 
  <p>Taking a big idea and breaking it down just like this list. The topic being "Thinking Like A Programmer".</p>

<p><h2><u> My Personal/Favorite HTML tags from the Example Code(Meaning inside HTML code)</u></h2></p>
  <p>Exclamation mark and 2 dashes <!--This thing! not sure how to write code in 'reference' yet but this helps!-->
  <p>Paragraph <!--<p> easiest html code. Whenever I want a paragraph I just do that, plus the close tag.-->
  <p>Italic? <!--Italics I am guessing is done by <em> thought it was no spacing, alternate of paragraph but its 'Italics'.-->
  <p>Bold <!--I love using this one its <b> for boldness!-->
  <p>H1-H6 font sizes <!--I'm sure there is better more customized version of font sizes but this is practical enough for fast html typing. -->
